These are simple <strong>standalone</strong> Python scripts when i need to <em> automate a boring task </em> or just have fun 

<h4>Note: All scripts in this repo were written with Python 3.X</h4> 

Also don't forget to <pre> pip install <em> modulename</em> </pre> if you see a module you haven't come across before until now.
The rest of the way is pretty straightforward and the codes have been commented, thus, very easy to understand, run and tweak even.

With ðŸ§¡, Maleem.
